# Intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-main [Using TailwindCSS]
Frontend-mentor Challenge: Intro section with dropdown navigations which I made using mostly tailwindcss, some css and vanilla JS.
This was a practice project to help me learn tailwindcss and...

## In this project I learned about:
- Setting up Tailwindcss.
- Using Tailwindcss to design a webpage. 
- Reading Tailwind Docs(which is again very elaborative and super easy to grasp).
- Making Responsive Navbar using Taiwind.
- Creating hamburger menu using JS and css.
- Creating multiple dropdowns using tailwindcss and JS.
- Creating mobile menu.

## Easy steps to install TailwindCSS
1. Go to the folder where you extracted it.
3. Open it in VS code and open the terminal.
4. Run `$ npm install -D tailwindcss` command ( to create your tailwind dependencies ).
5. Followed by `$ npx tailwindcss init` ( to create your tailwind.config.js file ).
6. Now go to your `"tailwind.config.js"` file and within "[ ]" of the content write the path to your html inside double qoutes ( here it's in my root folder so the path is `"./*.html"` ).
7. Then create a css file ( named `'input.css'` here ) in the root directory (or inside a folder).
8. And now finally, run the command `$ npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./css/main.css --watch` ( here main.css is the file that will have all the css you will use in your project ).
- #### Now you can finally start writing tailwindcss in your html!! :relieved: 

### Will be putting more about the above points soon to help folks with this challenge :)
