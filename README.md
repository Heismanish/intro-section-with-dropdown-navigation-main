# Intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-main [Using TailwindCSS]
Frontend-mentor Challenge: Intro section with dropdown navigations which I made using mostly tailwindcss, some css and vanilla JS.
This was a practice project to help me learn tailwindcss and...

## In this project I learned about:
- Setting up Tailwindcss.
- Using Tailwindcss to design a webpage. 
- Reading Tailwind Docs(which is again very elaborative and super easy to grasp).
- Making Responsive Navbar using Taiwind.
- Creating hamburger menu using JS and css.
- Creating multiple dropdowns using tailwindcss and JS.
- Creating mobile menu.

### Will be putting more about the above points soon to help folks with this challenge :)
